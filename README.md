# u17553z-OS
Owning multiple linux daily drivers, I need to achieve workflow parity to get closer to my ideal LifeOS which automates everything for me and tells me what to do to GTD and health-maxx. NixOS, being declarative, sounds like the perfect option. But I have no experience in it, so this repo will contain the history of me slowly crafting my dream OS! Will also document my current understanding of the Nix manager and flakes or whatever.

# Principles for my OS
- Linux distro agnostic, terminal-desktop-environment.
- **No memorization needed**, fuzzy-finding and icon/ hints/ LLM / good intuitive UX, like a well made game.
- Minimialist.
- Open-source stuff.
- Automated widgets e.g. RemNote / SuperMemo/ TickTick data all combined into a central, always visible "desktop background" terminal, with a GUI (in the terminal), like the maccel terminal.
  
# Installation guide
- [ ] Run the Nix bootstrap command or smth idk.
