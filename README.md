# u17553z-OS
Owning multiple linux daily drivers, I need to achieve workflow parity to get closer to my ideal LifeOS which automates everything for me and tells me what to do to GTD and health-maxx. NixOS, being declarative, sounds like the perfect option. But I have no experience in it, so this repo will contain the history of me slowly crafting my dream OS!!
