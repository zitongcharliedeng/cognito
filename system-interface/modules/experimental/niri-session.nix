    # TODO: Implement streaming layout script for Niri using:
    # - Niri's layout system for 1:4:1 arrangement
    # - Window positioning via Niri's API
    # - Application launching and workspace management
    # 
    # Original streaming layout logic (commented for future revival):
    # 1. Launch applications: obs, steam, discord
    # 2. Wait for applications to load
    # 3. Get screen dimensions using xrandr or Niri's display API
    # 4. Calculate 1:4:1 layout ratios (top: 1/6, center: 4/6, bottom: 1/6)
    # 5. Use Niri's layout system to arrange windows programmatically
    # 6. Apply tiling constraints to prevent floating behavior
    #
    # Key differences for Niri implementation:
    # - Use Niri's layout system instead of GNOME Shell JavaScript API
    # - Use Niri's window management commands instead of Meta.Window
    # - Use Niri's workspace management for application placement
    # - Leverage Niri's mandatory tiling (no floating windows possible)
