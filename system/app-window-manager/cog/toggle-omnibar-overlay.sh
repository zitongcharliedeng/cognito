# NAMING CONVENTION: Scripts without "_" prefix are public user actions
# that can be called directly by users or other scripts. These appear in
# omnibar menus and are the main interface for user interactions.
#
# Toggle the cognito omnibar overlay - the primary way to access any action in Cognito OS.
# This script will open the omnibar if it's closed, or close it if it's already open.
# This is the central command interface that provides fuzzy-finding access to all
# system functions, applications, and utilities without needing to memorize shortcuts.
#
# The omnibar follows the "Brain as Interface" principle - it should be intuitive
# enough that even someone with amnesia could navigate the system using only
# English language understanding.

# Check if rofi is already running and close it
if pgrep rofi >/dev/null; then
  echo "Omnibar is open - closing it"
  pkill rofi
  exit 0
fi

# Omnibar is not running - open it
echo "Omnibar is closed - opening it"

# Minimal inline overlay via rofi message (keeps config tiny and robust)
MESG="$(date '+%H:%M')  â€¢  placeholder"

# Create menu items using printf directly (avoids Nix escaping issues)
# -i flag enables case-insensitive matching
