# NAMING CONVENTION: Scripts prefixed with "_" are private helper functions
# that should only be called by other user-action scripts (like switch-workspace, 
# toggle-fullscreen, etc.). These helpers will never appear in omnibar menus, 
# like the other user-action wrapper scripts.
#
# Reserve space at top of screen for status bar
# AGS/HyprPanel cannot programmatically reserve Wayland layer space.
# so we use Hyprland workspace rules to create artificial top gaps for the status bar

# Reserve 52px at top for status bar (adjust as needed for your panel height)
# Use gapsout to create space at screen edges, not gapsin which affects window spacing
# DEBUG: Disabled gap manipulation - HyprPanel should handle space reservation
# hyprctl keyword workspace "1,gapsout:52"
